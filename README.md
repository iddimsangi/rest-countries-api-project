## My process
Learning and practicing more.
### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- React Hooks

### What I learned
Here are the key learnings from this project:

1. **React Fundamentals:** I gained a strong understanding of React, including components, state management, and routing using `react-router-dom`.

2. **API Integration:** I learned how to fetch and integrate data from external APIs into your React application.

3. **Conditional Rendering:** I mastered conditional rendering to display content based on different states or routes, such as filtering and navigating.

4. **Dark/Light Mode:** I implemented a dark/light mode toggle using state management and dynamic class names.

5. **Search Functionality:** I implemented a search feature to filter and display specific data based on user input.

6. **Route Navigation:** I used React Router to navigate between different pages in your application.

7. **Project Structure:** I organized your project into components and modules for a maintainable and scalable codebase.

8. **UI/UX Design:** I improved My skills in creating a user-friendly and responsive user interface.

Overall, I developed a full-fledged React application, incorporating various key concepts and best practices to create a functional and visually appealing project.


### Continued development

I will continue to practice using Tailwind CSS with React, and my upcoming projects will involve data fetching through APIs while implementing designs using Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://https://sass-lang.com//) - This helped me for buiding,guide and read all css clases reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
