## Overview

### The challenge
adding two background images positioned differently in the same container div was a bit tricky, if there will be any help please asist me.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard

## My process
Learning and practicing more.
### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Through this project, I had the opportunity to apply and enhance my skills and knowledge in combining Tailwind CSS with HTML5. The most enjoyable aspect was configuring my own custom CSS and successfully applying it. Additionally, working with a mobile-first approach was an amazing and powerful experience, particularly in achieving responsive design.


### Continued development

I will continue to practice using Tailwind CSS with React, and my upcoming projects will involve data fetching through APIs while implementing designs using Tailwind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for buiding,guide and read all css clases reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
